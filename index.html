            <h3>Why Alt School?</h3>
            <p>I came across a recording of a Twitter space hosted by Alt School Africa. The space featured a recent graduate of the school as a host and she shared her tech journey and how Alt School was fundamental in providing structured learning and a supportive environment for her career. This was more than enough to convince me that choosing Alt School would be the best decision for my tech career.</p>
